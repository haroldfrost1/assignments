<h3>1. Stakeholder Ethics</h3>
<h4>1.1 Identifying Key Stakeholders</h4>
<p>The term "stakeholders" refers to "the people involed in or affected by project activities, and include the project sponsor, project team, support staff, customers, users, suppliers, and even opponents of the project". (citation IT Project Management) According to the case study, the act of retaining metadata about customer's activities leads to great impact among people in Australia. Anyone who has connection of modern telecommunication technology could be a potential stakeholder in this project. Identified stakeholders are listed in the table below: </p>

<p>In this case, there are four groups of stakeholders who have the highest interest, which are The Abbott geoverment, Telecommunication Service Providersï¼Œ Police and Security Agencies and eventually the customers.</p>
<p>The Abbott government leads the act of letting telecommunication service providers retain customers activities for two years, which could consume a "substantial" amount of funds. The intention to capture the metadata is not only for "counter-terrorism, counter-espionage and foreign interference" but also for "fundamental in most of the crimes, particularly serious and organised crimes".(citation) The Abbott government is basic sponsor of this project which creates major conflicts in terms of privacy and domestic safety. There are parties stand against this project. For example, the Greens who stand for privacy and also claim that this project is imposing tax on the entire Australian population (citiation). However, the Abbott government takes national safety over economy and privacy, as Abbott said "When it comes to counter-terrorism everyone needs to be part of Team Australia..."(citation)</p>
