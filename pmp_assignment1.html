<h3>1. Stakeholder Ethics</h3>
<h4>1.1 Identifying Key Stakeholders</h4>
<p>The term "stakeholders" refers to "the people involed in or affected by project activities, and include the project sponsor, project team, support staff, customers, users, suppliers, and even opponents of the project". (citation IT Project Management) According to the case study, the act of retaining metadata about customer's activities leads to great impact among people in Australia. Anyone who has connection of modern telecommunication technology could be a potential stakeholder in this project. Identified stakeholders are listed in the table below: </p>

<p>In this case, there are four groups of stakeholders who have the highest interest, which are The Abbott geoverment, Telecommunication Service Providers, Police and Security Agencies and eventually the customers.</p>
<p>The Abbott government leads the act of letting telecommunication service providers retain customers activities for two years, which could consume a "substantial" amount of funds. The intention to capture the metadata is not only for "counter-terrorism, counter-espionage and foreign interference" but also for "fundamental in most of the crimes, particularly serious and organised crimes".(citation) The Abbott government is basic sponsor of this project which creates major conflicts in terms of privacy and domestic safety. There are parties stand against this project. For example, the Greens who stand for privacy and also claim that this project is imposing tax on the entire Australian population (citiation). However, the Abbott government puts national safety over economy and privacy, as Abbott said "When it comes to counter-terrorism everyone needs to be part of Team Australia..."(citation)</p>
<p>The telecommunication service providers(TSPs) are facing enormous pressure in need of updating infrastructure in order to collect vast amount of metadata. Although they tend to be resistant to the evolutionary change in the industry, they don't have much power to control. According to the ABC news, up to the date of 13th October, 2015, 84 per cent of ISPs believe that they are not given enough amount of time to be able to collect metadata following the law; Moreover, small TSPs convinced that they have been questioning themselves whether to continue on or to close down as they cannot afford the time and funds needed to be spent such regulatory act.(citation)</p>
<p>Among all customers, there must be two different perspectives to this project, excluding the group of customers who are unconscious or neutral to this act. Similar between the Abbott government and the opponent party, there is the group of customers which are supportive to this act holds the thought of putting public safety over econmy and their own privacy, while, there is another group who would not be willing to sacrifice their privacy for the public safety. Eventually, this project will cause great conflicts and influence in customers.</p>
<p>For police and security agencies, they are definitely supportive to this act because they believe that metadata is critical to counter-terrorism. However, they are in situation where there could be a revolutionary change in their regulatory work, as the metadata retention enables them to capture a much wider range of violations and crimes, which means a greater responsibility they have to bear. Just like the TSPs, they also have the need of updating infrstructure and work closely with the TSPs to efficiently utilize metadata to promote national security.</p>

<h4>1.2 Explaining major areas of conflict</h4>
<p>Major areas of conflict exist in between the government and TSPs and customers, predominately in regards to the choice between public safety and privacy.</p>
<p>With the reference of the article "A Guardian guide ot your metadata"(citation?), metadata defines customers' foot-print as customers use technology. Metadata is not only generated when users use technology with an internet connection but also when users use electronic devices such as camera. Metadata can be as specific as when, where and what content a user visit.</p>
<p>Hence, the act of data retention leads to customers' concern about their privacy. As Baker & McKenzie's Fair told Fairfax Media, agencies will have the right to review a person's metadata at any time without acknowledging that person and might use the metadata for or against that person(citation). It is humanity to be concerned with self privacy being exposed to anyone else, which is also what the Greens believed, that data retention violates humanity. Moreover, there is not yet any decent law could ease this concern.</p>
<p>In the perspective of the Abbott government, public safety overrides personal privacy. It is comprehensible for the government to take such act, since the recent presence of terrorist attacks in Australia. For example, the latest case of terrorist attack took place in Parramatta, where a 15-year-old boy was shot dead by a police officer, while NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione suggested it was a politically motivated attack linked to terrorism.</p>
<p>According to the American lawyer for whistleblower Edward Snowden and Ben Wizner, it can hardly be proved that data retention could be helpful to national security in solving terror crimes. Besides, it is also everyone's choice to accept this act which may improve national security. Therefore, It is still debatable between these perspectives.</p>

<h4>1.3 Relevant ethical views taken by each key stakeholders</h4>
<h5>The Abbott Government : Deontology</h5>
<p>As Tony Abbott said,"The highest priority of government is the safety of our community and I want to ensure the Australian people that w will leave no stone unturned to ensure that our community is as safe as it can be". It shows Abbott believes that he/the government has the duty to protect the Australian community in any manner. Also, he believes that everyone has the obligation to make their choice on public safety instead of person privacy, while he said "When it comes to counter-terrorism everyone needs to be part of Team Australia." It is clearly that the Abbott government stands for deontology at this stage.</p>

<h5>Telecommunication Service Providers : Consequentialism</h5>
<p>TSPs tend to be resistant in this project because great effort and considerable amount of resources are necessary to achieve the goal in this project. In regards to the ethical view, the consequence of this project causes such a significant change in the industry that most of the TSPs are not prepared as aforementioned in this report. It is evident that TSPs stand for consequentialism in this project.</p>

<h5>Customers : Relativism and Ethical pluralism</h5>
<p>In the group of customers, there must be diverse perspectives. Part of customers may believe that this act has violated their personal privacy; Another part of customers may be willing to sacrifice their personal privacy to improve national security. However, if the act does not prove itself to be helpful to the national security, or if there are metadata misued which leads to negative feedback on this project, customers will lost their original belief. Therefore, the ethical view of the customers is relative and dependent on the success of this act. It is accepted that there are diverse ethical view among customers. This indicates relativism and ethical pluralism.</p>

<h5>Police and Security Agencies : Consequentialism</h5>
<p>It is clear that police and security agencies together holds consequentialism. They believe that after implementing this project, metadata collected is critically helpful to counter-terrorism, counter-espionage and foerign interference, as the chief the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), Duncan Lewis said(citation). In other words, they believe the consequence of this act will bring benefit to the society, which indicates consequetialism.</p>

<h4>1.4 Personal View</h4>
<p>As a professional project manager in the future industry, I personally believe that the Abbott Government is handling national security issues in the right manner. In my opinion, it is necessary to let police and security agencies to have access to metadata, since the recent vital activities from terrorism have become savage, despite the effect to the industry and individuals. In regards to deontology, TSPs have the greatest duty to help government with their metadata, neglecting the cost to implement this act. Individuals should believe that this act is fair that everyone's privacy will be treated in the same way. After all, in some way of saying, if a person doesn't need to be worried about anything unless he/she is potential criminal.</p>

<h3>2. International Codes of Ethics</h3>
<h4>2.1 Code evaluation on the case study and stakeholders</h4>
<p>In this report, Code of Conduct from two groups have been reviewed, which are Australian Computer Society (ACS) and British Computer Society (BCS). Both Codes have listed the primacy of public interest as their first item. It can be well used to evaluate this case study. In regards to these two Code, ACS suggests "the public interest takes precedence over personal, private and sectional interests, and any conflicts should be resolved in favour of the public interest", while BCS also claims "have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment". In this case study, national safety shall be considered as public interest, which should be taken precedence over personal privacy, as national safety could benefit the whole community while protecting personal privacy focuses on individuals. Hence, the Abbott Government is most likely to be supported by the Code, as the Abbott Government's goal is to enhance national security, although in the way of "sacrificing" privacy which has a lower precedence regarding to the Code.</p>

<h4>2.2 Difference between Codes</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Although both Codes have similar suggestions in general, the Code from ACS seems to be more generously addressing ethics for anyone in the IT industry, while BCS has specific items for specific group. BCS has an item focused on "Duty to Relevant Authority", which suggests "NOT disclose or authorise to be disclosed, or use for personal gain or to benefit a third party, confidential information except with the permission of your Relevant Authority, or as required by Legislation". In relation to this case study, the Abbott Government, which is the relevant authority, has taken effort to follow this code, so they try to pass the act of data retention through a lawful way. However, this item is absent the Code from ACS.</p>

<h3>3. Problems of Advancing Technology</h3>
<p>With the rapid growth in technology, comes with more problems involve technology. The problems are only for example. They do not include all the problems arose in regards to technology.</p>
<h4>3.1 Radioactive Pollution</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>3.2 Cloning-to-produce-human</h4>
<p>Current technology has already enabled human to reproduce human using cloning technology. Organismal or repoductive cloning is a genetic technology to produce identical organisms. There is a famous example of cloning, Dolly the sheep. It was born on 1996</p>
<h4>3.3 Impact of Online Shopping On Retail Property</h4>
