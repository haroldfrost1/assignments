<h3>1. Stakeholder Ethics</h3>
<h4>1.1 Identifying Key Stakeholders</h4>
<p>The term "stakeholders" refers to "the people involed in or affected by project activities, and include the project sponsor, project team, support staff, customers, users, suppliers, and even opponents of the project". (citation IT Project Management) According to the case study, the act of retaining metadata about customer's activities leads to great impact among people in Australia. Anyone who has connection of modern telecommunication technology could be a potential stakeholder in this project. Identified stakeholders are listed in the table below: </p>

<p>In this case, there are four groups of stakeholders who have the highest interest, which are The Abbott geoverment, Telecommunication Service Providers, Police and Security Agencies and eventually the customers.</p>
<p>The Abbott government leads the act of letting telecommunication service providers retain customers activities for two years, which could consume a "substantial" amount of funds. The intention to capture the metadata is not only for "counter-terrorism, counter-espionage and foreign interference" but also for "fundamental in most of the crimes, particularly serious and organised crimes".(citation) The Abbott government is basic sponsor of this project which creates major conflicts in terms of privacy and domestic safety. There are parties stand against this project. For example, the Greens who stand for privacy and also claim that this project is imposing tax on the entire Australian population (citiation). However, the Abbott government puts national safety over economy and privacy, as Abbott said "When it comes to counter-terrorism everyone needs to be part of Team Australia..."(citation)</p>
<p>The telecommunication service providers(TSPs) are facing enormous pressure in need of updating infrastructure in order to collect vast amount of metadata. Although they are aware of the enormous change in the industry, they don't have much power to control. According to the ABC news, up to the date of 13th October, 2015, 84 per cent of ISPs believe that they are not given enough amount of time to be able to collect metadata following the law; Moreover, small TSPs convinced that they have been questioning themselves whether to continue on or to close down as they cannot afford the time and funds needed to be spent such regulatory act.(citation)</p>
<p>Among all customers, there must be two different perspectives to this project, excluding the group of customers who are unconscious or neutral to this act. Similar between the Abbott government and the opponent party, there is the group of customers which are supportive to this act holds the thought of putting public safety over econmy and their own privacy, while, there is another group who would not be willing to sacrifice their privacy for the public safety. Eventually, this project will cause great conflicts and influence in customers.</p>
<p>For police and security agencies, they are definitely supportive to this act because they believe that metadata is critical to counter-terrorism. However, they are in situation where there could be a revolutionary change in their regulatory work, as the metadata retention enables them to capture a much wider range of violations and crimes, which means a greater responsibility they have to bear. Just like the TSPs, they also have the need of updating infrstructure and work closely with the TSPs to efficiently utilize metadata to promote national security.</p>

<h4>1.2 Explaining major areas of conflict</h4>
<p>Major areas of conflict exist in between the government and TSPs and customers. Predominately, the conflict rises in topics: privacy, safety and resources.</p>
<p>With the reference of the article "A Guardian guide ot your metadata"(citation?), metadata defines customers' foot-print as customers use technology. Metadata is not only generated when users use technology with an internet connection but also when users use electronic devices such as camera. Metadata can be as specific as when, where and what content a user visit.</p>
<p>Hence, the act of data retention leads to customers' concern about their privacy. As Baker & McKenzie's Fair told Fairfax Media, agencies will have the right to review a person's metadata at any time without acknowledging that person and might use the metadata for or against that person(citation). It is humanity to be concerned with self privacy being exposed to anyone else, which is also what the Greens believed, that data retention violates humanity. Moreover, there is not yet any decent law could ease this concern.</p>
<p>In the perspective of the Abbott government, public overrides personal privacy. It is comprehensible for the government to take such act, since the recent presence of terrorist attacks in Australia. For example, the latest case of terrorist attack took place in Parramatta, where a 15-year-old boy was shot dead by a police officer, while NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione suggested it was a politically motivated attack linked to terrorism.</p>
<p>According to the American lawyer for whistleblower Edward Snowden and Ben Wizner, it can hardly be proved that data retention could be helpful to national security in solving terror crimes. Besides, it is also everyone's choice to accept this act which may improve national security.</p>
<p>It is still debatable between these perspectives.</p>
